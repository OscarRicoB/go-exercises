# Golang Practice Exercises

On this repo I'm going to be putting Golang exercises resolved from time to time to kill some boredom or to practice a little.

Feel free to fork or suggest any improvements and variants to my solutions, this will help me to improve and look at different solutions perspectives

## Run tests

You can run the tests through the Makefile as follows

**Verbose run**
this will run the tests and output the expected returns if the test pass or the given result and the expected return if the test fails

```bash
make test_verbose
```

**Non-verbose run**
this will run the tests and output only the given result and the expected return of failed tests

```bash
make test
```
